# Editor PrevNext Navigation

Editor PrevNext Navigation is a free plugin for WordPress. It adds a pretty simple Prev/Next navigation to the post/page editor so you can don't have to back each time you want to edit multiple posts "batch style".

With this plugin you can navigate or browse within the post type group the currently opened document belongs to. So it's not limited to posts or pages but allows custom post types as well.

## One Warning Though

When you click one of the navigation elements the next or previous document will be loaded into the editor without checking for changes in the current document! Keep that in mind and always make sure to hit the "update" button before you move on. Otherwise all changes will be lost!
